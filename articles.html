                            <h3>Philosophy of the show</h3>
                            <div class="col-md-8 about-desc">
                                <p>Drawing inspiration from the science fiction horror pioneered by H.P. Lovecraft and based on a philosophical school of thought called Absurdism, “Rick and Morty” explores the conflict between the human tendency to seek meaning in life and the subsequent inability to find any. Sharing a common theoretical basis with existentialism and nihilism, the absurdity that unfolds in each episode is based on the idea that its characters are relentlessly caught up in a dichotomy with meaningless, illogical situations and actual life.
                                This is evident in the differences between Rick—who seems to be on a constant search for the meaning of life—and Jerry, who, because of his own blissful stupidity, is perfectly content with ignorance and toiling away at the mediocrity of his own life.</p>
                                <p>Episode "Rick Potion #9"is an excellent example of how characters struggle between seeking the meaning of life and the knowledge that there is no point in living anyway. When Morty develops a crush on a girl at school, he employs the help of his grandfather to provide him a love serum to his love interest requite his affection. In a series of absurd events that occur after Rick attempts to administer the serum to her—and subsequently provide an antidote—the world’s population is quickly turned into horrible mutated mantis-people who want to eat Morty.</p>
                                <p>Soon, Rick realizes that the situation has reached a point beyond repair. Rather than create another antidote, he finds another dimension in which two specific things have occurred: alternate versions of themselves have created a working antidote, but they have also died after discovering the antidote. Rick and Morty enter this new dimension, bury the bodies of their own selves in the backyard and slip right back into a new version of the same reality—with no one else noticing the insanity that has just occurred. Morty is horrified at the sight of his own disfigured corpse and the task of burying it as if nothing has happened.His frantic concern is addressed by Rick in the simplest of ways:</p>
                                <p>Morty: “But what about the reality we’ve left behind?”</p>
                                <p>Rick: “The answer is, “Don’t think about it.”</p>
                                <p>This is one of the most important lines in all of the show. Don’t think about the possibilities that may occur in other universes, don’t think about the death of your other self—just accept that it happened and resume your life in the next dimension. In the vein of absurdism and the conflict between Rick’s active and passive nihilistic perspective, it is best to embrace the pointlessness of life and move on from it.</p>

                                <p>"Pickle Rick" is the third episode of the third season of series Rick and Morty.In "Pickle Rick", the eccentric scientist Rick Sanchez turns himself into a pickle just as he and his family are scheduled to attend a therapy session. The episode separately follows Rick's adventures as a pickle and the rest of the family's trip to therapy.</p>
                                <p>Rick's obstacles start small and then gradually get more and more insane. Even in a show like Rick and Morty, things get weird, but because we're gradually building toward the violence and humanity happens in the lab, we're completely along for the ride.</p>
                                <p>The episode was watched by 2.3 million viewers when it first aired on Adult Swim, having been a highly anticipated episode for the show's fanbase. The episode received positive reviews, particularly praising the animation and design of Pickle Rick and his fight scenes, as well as the performance of guest actors Danny Trejo (as Jaguar) and Susan Sarandon (as Dr. Wong). It won the 2018 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program, which was the first Emmy Award won by Rick and Morty.</p>

                            <div class="col-md-8 about-desc">
                                <p>If you haven’t seen the show, its popularity might seem strange when you learn that Rick Sanchez is one of the most unpleasant characters on television. He’s the hero of the show, but he’s also a high-functioning alcoholic who constantly wears a splash of discoloured saliva on his chin, belches obnoxiously mid-sentence, and generally does whatever takes his fancy or whatever will further his quest for scientific discovery – including theft, cold-blooded murder and brutally insulting his family members, which whom he lives.Rick asserts that he is “surrounded by inferior pieces of shit” and savagely insults the intelligence of his mostly-likeable grandkids and just about anyone else around him. Granted, he is a proven genius of significant resource and guile, so his arrogance may not be misplaced. But he is undoubtedly mean, selfish and disgusting.
                                </p>
                                <p>On the surface, Rick is vicious and self-centred. But the show gradually reveals his nihilistic world-view, which might explain his often-dour expression. Nothing matters in an uncaring reality, he would say. Rick abandoned his daughter as a child to pursue his scientific endeavours and never showed any sign of regret.And yet, in the Season 2 finale, Rick sacrifices his freedom for the sake of his family, a moment meaningfully underscored by "Hurt" from Nine Inch Nails. Rick’s nonsensical catchphrase, always said with verve and a smile, is revealed to secretly translate as "I am in great pain, please help me".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                But it isn’t Rick’s inner depth of character that makes a largely hateful man likable.It’s because no matter his methods, Rick is good at what he does.Rick is an arsehole, but he can always explain a complicated situation and how he is going to resolve it.Whether it’s more basic expositional dialogue, like explaining the characteristics of a particular alien race to the clueless Morty, or filling the viewer in on the plot so far, the result is that Rick is shown to be knowledgeable and capable.
